# Engineering Documentation

This repository is a "catch-all" for assorted software engineering and
development documentation. It is suggested that each document have a
separate directory.

In the root of that document specific directory should be a "shareable"
version of the document (or, perhaps "published" is a better word)
in whatever makes the most sense.

Please keep in mind, this is a public repository.
